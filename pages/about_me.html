                  long-lasting work-relationship.</p>
                <p class="about-description">For me UX design is all about communication
                  and honesty.</p>
                <p class="about-description">I am a <span class="emphasized">User Experience Designer</span>
                  with <span class="emphasized">10 years</span> of experience. I strongly believe in data,
                  content driven design, testing with users, iteration and listening to people. In most cases,
                  these methods work well enough for any project I am working on.</p>
                <p class="about-description">You will rarely hear me talk about "Saliency", "Double diamonds",
                  "Lean Design Thinking" or any other lingo typical for people in my profession. Over
                  the years of working in the industry I've learned that the UX vocabulary evolves faster than
                  its methods.</p>

              <h3 class="about-details-title">How do I grow as a professional?</h3>
              <p class="about-description custom-margin">Since 2013 I am privileged to teach various UX topics to postgraduate students at SWPS University in Warsaw, Wroclaw, and Katowice. Helping students understand UX is a great enabler of my professional growth.</p>
			  <p class="about-description custom-margin">I read a lot of books, scour through various forums and subreddits related to the kind of work I am doing.
                Some of those are strictly about UX topics, though most are about psychology and cognitive science.</p>
              <p class="about-description">Last but not least, I learn on the job. Each project, test and analysis
                is an opportunity to learn something new for me UX design is all about
                communication and honesty.</p>
              <p class="about-description">Before I left to work in Gibraltar, I was a very
                active member of UX community. I participated in lectures, some of them were
                organised by me. I was mentoring a few people who wanted to become a part of
                the UX world. For a few years I was also running a UX Book Club. Have a look at my CV
                (link in the navigation) to read more about my after work activities. Since I am back in Warsaw,
                I am going to be slowly re-integrating myself with the community.</p>

                I am invested in the digital world and my plan for the next couple of years is to
                take on more challenging products and services.</p>
              <p class="about-description custom-margin">I would really like to get back to being a member of a UX community.
