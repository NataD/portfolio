                <ul class="notes-list">
                  <li>Don’t allow people to do a site­ wide search if the search
                    results will not be relevant to the user’s query</li>
                  <li>Support phonetic misspellings corrections</li>
                  <li>Users mix filtering and sorting</li>
                  <li>To provide high ­quality search suggestions, look at how
                    suggestions are generated. Many suggestions that are redundant,
                    of low quality or typos are likely the result of developers
                    sourcing suggestions from the website’s search logs. If this
                    strategy doesn’t take into account the success of those queries
                    (that is, whether a decent percentage of users found and purchased
                    products after performing those searches), then it is flawed.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="notes-details-section">
                <h3 class="notes-details-title">Search field design</h3>
                <p class="notes-description custom-margin">The search field represents the initial
                  step of the user’s search process, it’s design can influence
                  the user’s entire approach to how they find products on the site.</p>
                <div class="notes-details-subsection">
                  <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">How should the user Journey for searching products begin?</h5>
                  <ul class="notes-list">
                    <li>Query search ­is preferred when the user already knows the specific
                      item they want (e.g. Artistry Trolley Bag). Search is also often
                      chosen first in case the site has a very complex product catalog.</li>
                    <li>Category browsing ­is preferred when the user doesn’t yet know
                      the exact product they want. The other reason to use this type of
                      search is when the product catalog structure is flat.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="notes-details-subsection">
                  <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">Which should be more prominent?</h5>
                  <p class="notes-description">Depending on the company needs, one option
                    can be more prominent than the other. For example, if the search field
                    is to be more prominent, certain design tweaks have to be implemented.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">How to make Search field more prominent?</h5>
                <p class="notes-description">There are three elements to consider:</p>
                <ul class="notes-list">
                  <li>Position - Placing the search field in the centre of page,</li>
                  <li>Contrast - Increase the contrast of field border, input text,
                    search button and provide enough padding around the field,</li>
                  <li>Size - The larger the search field (and input text)
                    the more prominent it will appear.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="notes-description">Optionally, it may be a good idea to
                  dynamically change the contrast of the search field on certain pages.
                  For example, when user is already viewing a product he was interested in.</p>
                <p class="notes-description">During testing, the more prominent
                  the search field was featured on a test site, the more the test
                  subjects regarded it as the site encouraging them to search
                  (instead of navigating via the categories). therefore, in industries
                  where search is the preferred product finding strategy, it can be
                  beneficial to “promote” the search field with a prominent design and placement,
                  especially on the user’s landing page (usually the homepage).</p>
                <p class="notes-description">On the other hand, in industries where
                  the majority of users will generally prefer to use category
                  navigation (most often because they don’t yet know which exact
                  product they want or what it’s called), or in case the site’s hierarchy is
                  completely flat, a less attention-grabbing search field design may be employed
                  to encourage category navigation over search.</p>
                <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">Query types</h5>
                <p class="notes-description">There are at least 12 main types of query search
                  found in usability study of 50 e­commerce sites.</p>

                  most e­-commerce sites typically end up a mess, with irrelevant search

                <h3 class="notes-details-title">Autocomplete</h3>
                <p class="notes-description">Properly implemented autocomplete feature is not
                  about speeding up the search process but rather about guiding the user
                  and lending them a helping hand in constructing their search query.</p>
                <p class="notes-description">Autocomplete feature is proven to directly alter the how
                  and what the user is searching for. It is critical to follow a number of design and
                  interaction patterns to ensure that autocomplete design aligns with user expectations.</p>
                <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">Style auxiliary data differently</h5>
                <p class="notes-description">Any auxiliary data in the suggestion – such as
                  category scopes or number of matches – should be styled differently
                  from the actual suggested search terms. Otherwise, the user won’t be able to
                  tell at a glance what is (and isn’t) part of the suggested search terms.</p>
                <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">Avoid scrollbars and keep the list manageable</h5>
                <p class="notes-description">Having a separate scroll area within an already
                  interactive widget is a recipe for interaction disaster, and should be avoided
                  in favour of simply having the widget expand to its natural size. Furthermore,
                  the list of autocomplete suggestions should be kept to a maximum of around
                  10 items to avoid inducing choice paralysis.</p>
                <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">Highlight the differences</h5>
                <p class="notes-description">It’s a good idea to style the entered and suggested
                  termsdifferently so the user can easily tell what’s suggested.</p>

                  those aged 50+, would use the mouse to select autocomplete suggestions,

                <p class="notes-description">Sorting and filtering of search results is a vital part
                  of users finding the right products among the results. In a perfect world,
                  there should be little need for these functionalities, but user will never
                  be able to make perfectly specified queries, simply because many will be at
                  a stage in their purchase decision process where they haven’t fully decided
                  or realised what they are looking for.</p>
                <h5 class="notes-details-subtitle">General recommendations</h5>
                <ul class="notes-list">
                  <li>Search results should always be sorted by their “Relevance”
                    to the user’s query.</li>
                  <li>Users should be able to sort by price in both directions.
                    They are looking for best value for money.</li>
                  <li>It is vital to remember, that sorting by price may yield
                    undesirable results to show on top, e.g. when searching for a TV
                    and then sorting the results by price, accessories such as mounting
                    brackets may end up on the top of the list</li>
                  <li>Provide users with the ability to sort by both “Bestselling”
                    and “Best rated”.</li>
                  <li>Have category-specific sorting attributes (e.g. “TV Screen size:
                    High to low”).</li>
                  <li>Promote scope selection within the sorting widget (e.g. “Choose
                    a Department to enable sorting” - Amazon).</li>
                  <li>Consider filtering out accessories from the results list.</li>
