                ATMs and 50% of traffic was coming from mobile. I leveraged that information and together with

              <p class="selected-project-description">To properly prepare myself for this project
                I purchased <a href="https://baymard.com/ecommerce-product-lists">Product Lists & Filtering</a> report
                from Baymard Institute. It helped me to understand various aspects of product catalogues.
                This project was heavily tested and iterated upon. The end result brought the conversion up by 12%.
                We also noticed that more people are browsing the catalogue, and spend more time on it. </p>

              <p class="selected-project-description">Registration of a new account often seems like a trivial challenge at best.
                Amway depends heavily on MLM scheme. Only people who were previously approached by a Business Owner can register
                on the website. Based on this requirement, I introduced a BO finder right on the registration page.
                Though I believe the biggest success of the project was splitting the registration into 4 steps. We pitched
                this idea to the business and provided rationale that in case of this project this will prove to be successful.
                Thorough testing and 20% increase conversion confirmed our hypothesis.</p>

              <p class="selected-project-description">Casino managers have to solve a variety of problems while working
                in a busy environment such as the Casino floor. One of the biggest challenges they were facing
                was handling overflowing coins in a machine.</p>
              <p class="selected-project-description">Together with the team of researchers I spent quite
                a lot of time on the floor, taking notes, observing and shadowing managers while they were working.
                The initial idea to help solve their problem was to utilise the tablets they were carrying around
                at all times. After some exploration we decided to discard it in favour of a system accessible
                from any machine on the floor with the turn of a key.</p>

                Not to mention lack of any data for that platform. Nevertheless, with the help from Microsoft team and
                their design guidelines we managed to deliver a solution which held a 3rd place in Windows Marketplace for 2 years.</p>

                the tablet minimal adoption and flexibility in terms of design for BlackBerry devices
                we were able to experiment with the final solution. It took a few iterations,
                but we managed to deliver an app which received quite a few good reviews.
                Even though the tablet had a short shelf-life, we learned a great deal.</p>
