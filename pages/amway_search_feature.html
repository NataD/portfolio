                  various metrics around the Search feature to measure its performance. Unfortunately,

                <p class="faq-description">I decided to focus on getting the knowledge from the
                  <a href="https://baymard.com/ecommerce-search" target="_blank" class="sources-links">Baymard
                  Institute E-Commerce Search Usability Report</a> which has proven to be a
                  <span class="emphasized">very</span> valuable source of information. I am going to nerd-out
                  for a bit here, so I apologise up front. This report was one of the best things I read
                  since the beginning of my career. The quality of the materials and the amount of
                  research were invaluable.</p>
                <p class="faq-description">I highly recommend reading through my notes from that report.</p>

                <p class="faq-description">Reports were very comprehensive, but I wanted to learn more.
                  I found two books which looked promising "<a href="https://searchpatterns.org/" target="_blank" class="sources-links">
                  Search Patterns: Design for Discovery</a>" by Peter Morville and
                  "<a href="http://designingthesearchexperience.com/" target="_blank" class="sources-links">Designing
                  the Search Experience: The Information Architecture of Discovery</a>" by Tony Russel-Rose.
                  Both books were quite interesting, but unfortunately not as detailed as aforementioned
                  report. Nevertheless, armed with the knowledge and passion I was ready to begin working with
                  the Scrum team on the new Search feature project.</p>

                <p class="faq-description">Since this project was relatively easy in terms of design
                  requirements, I jumped straight into defining use cases, flows and sketches.
                  This stage was a part of sprint zero, where the entire Scrum team was involved.
                  We discussed potential risks, constraints and solutions. After we finalised
                  most of the conceptual work, I designed a hi fidelity prototype which later
                  served as a DoD from UX perspective.</p>

                  quickly deliver new wireframes, and help solve problems rising along the way.
                  I participated in all Scrum activities; groomings sessions, planning poker,

                  we started working on it, so we couldn't compare results after we shipped our product
                  to production. It didn't matter as much, since the feature was broken from the start
                  we were expecting the numbers to go up. Me and Data Analyst focused on several metrics;
                  number of people using the search feature, completeness of results, how results
                  match the query, user paths, time to product, time to purchase.</p>
