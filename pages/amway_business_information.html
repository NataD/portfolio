                <p class="faq-description">I gave the participants the following tasks:</p>
                <ul class="faq-description-list amway-list">
                  <li>Read the latest news about specific products</li>
                  <li>Next, download the latest issue of the catalogue</li>
                  <li>Finally, sign-up for a training session.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="faq-description">During the test I was observing and recording all
                  interactions and paths participants were taking to accomplish the tasks.
                  I also asked them to comment out loud on anything they were doing while performing the task.</p>
                <p class="faq-description">The results were promising.</p>

                  a testing session was an additional navigation at the bottom of each page.
                  The users were following a certain path and having it at the bottom allowed
                  them to go through the journey much more smoothly.</p>
