                <div class="faq-details-subsection">
                  <h5 class="faq-details-subtitle">Problem definition</h5>
                  <p class="faq-description">Users review suggestions from our system on a daily basis.
                    A significant number of users get 100 and more suggestions per day.
                    It takes a long time to go through each and every one of them in search for an outlier.
                    In most cases, users are accepting all suggestions but the ones which are either
                    exceptionally expensive or have a large number of items.</p>
                    <p class="faq-description">How can we improve the system so that a large number of
                      suggestions can be easily divided into most commonly accepted and outliers?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-details-subsection">
                  <h5 class="faq-details-subtitle">Feature</h5>
                  <p class="faq-description">During shadowing sessions, we observed that the users have a cost
                    value above which they are very careful to accept the suggestion. The value changes
                    based on the size of the company. For some it is everything that costs more than 50 USD and
                    for others 1000 USD. Any suggestion below those values can be accepted without having
                    to analyze it carefully.</p>
                  <p class="faq-description">We came up with 3 level analysis tool which allows the user to
                    go through the suggestions on 3 different levels of detail. 1st level shows a
                    normal distribution chart, 2nd level divides the suggestions into cost value buckets and 3rd level
                    is just a list of suggestions in a table.</p>

                <div class="faq-details-subsection">
                  <h5 class="faq-details-subtitle">Problems and challenges</h5>
                  <p class="faq-description">During testing the biggest challenge we faced was a
                    lack of trust from users that the 1st level of detail gives them accurate information.
                    The users were afraid that within the “green” region there can be some suggestions
                    which they don’t want even though in the past they accepted those suggestions
                    from the list view.</p>
                  <p class="faq-description">We conducted many user interviews to identify what is
                    the root cause of the mistrust. As a result, we decided to earn the trust
                    of the users by not allowing them to accept suggestions on the first level
                    of analysis. Instead the first level of analysis would simply divide
                    the suggestions into buckets “Safe to accept” and “Need revision”.
                    By going to the first bucket, the users wouldn’t need to spend as
                    much time analyzing the suggestions. They could just briefly look
                    through the list and use the accept en masse button. We hypothesized
                    that in time, users will learn to trust the system and begin accepting
                    the suggestions without having to go through the list.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-details-title custom-margin">Overriding process</h3>
                <div class="faq-details-subsection">
                  <h5 class="faq-details-subtitle">Problem definition</h5>
                  <p class="faq-description">Our system gives users many different suggestions
                    about their inventory. It may suggest the user to stop stocking a particular item.
                    Or to decrease the order level. The user, however, has the option to override
                    the suggestion. It can happen for a variety of reasons. Maybe the user knows
                    that a client will come who wants to get a specific amount of items as a one time deal
                    and they want to make sure the right amount of stock will be available for purchase.
                    If the user accepted the suggestion to decrease the stock, the workers could’ve
                    returned unnecessary items from the warehouse and as a result the client
                    would not be able to get their order.</p>
                  <p class="faq-description">The downside of applying an override is a decrease of compliance
                    KPI which can result in the removal of return rights for items with overrides.</p>

                  <p class="faq-description">The only way for us to ensure the user knows about the risks
                    of using an override is the proper placement of information about those risks
                    during the process of applying an override.</p>
                  <p class="faq-description">The first version of the override process was designed and
                    implemented inline.</p>
                  <p class="faq-description">Because the first version didn’t perform well after
                    implementation we decided to move the entire process to a sidebar.</p>
                  <p class="faq-description">Initial tests are promising. Lessons learned during
                    the previous implementation told us we need to test this feature more extensively.
                    We have two sessions planned for June and July. As well as a quantitative test which
                    will be done in Axure+HoJar on a much larger group of users.</p>

                    the users were able to complete their task with minimal effort and generally
                    understood what was happening on the screen. However, when we finally implemented
                    this feature and released it to the public, we started getting a lot of complaints
                    that it’s not clear enough when the overrides are actually applied and what does
                    it mean for the user.</p>
                  <p class="faq-description">We should’ve tested this feature on a wider audience
                    instead of a small group of 6 users. Perhaps an interactive prototype with
                    analytic tools could’ve given us a better answer.</p>
